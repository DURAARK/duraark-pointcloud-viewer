HALL OF SHAME
=============

1) Slovenian Environment Agency or ARSO (Agencija Republike Slovenije za okolje)

   for providing "pseudo-open" access to their national LiDAR data by only
   offering downloads in the proprietary "Optimized LAS" or "zLAS" format
   also known as the "LAZ clone"

   use the "LASliberator" [1,2,3] to set the enslaved Slovenian LiDAR free 
   
2) ...



The "HALL OF SHAME" is our funny-provocative and dicussion-starting way to
assure that our "open LiDAR data" is stored and distributed in our "open
LiDAR formats" to the benefits of users on any platform using any software. 

We list agencies or portals that are distributers of "locked-up LiDAR"
and promote proprietary LiDAR formats by providing raw "pseudo-open" point
clouds exclusively in closed formats such as *.sid, *.zlas, *.rar, ... 




We are taking "HALL OF SHAME" nominations ... (-;
